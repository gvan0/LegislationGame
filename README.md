## OBJECTIVE
The goal is to help your constituents by meeting their demands.

## COMPONENTS
Your starter kit should have come with:
40 blue cards and 240 red cards. 
### SET UP
Draw unique blue cards to select issues (~2 per player).  Pick all related red issue cards and shuffle.  Deal four red cards to each player. Players will need to discard and redraw until they have four different issues. Each player begins with four money tokens.


## GAMEPLAY
Each person will take turns acting as chairperson, presenting a bill they want to pass. Players should decide in advance how play progresses. See House Rules for suggestions.

## PROPOSALS
#### Bill
Each turn starts with playing two or more blue cards. This is the core bill.

#### Discussion
After the bill is presented, players place their vote tokens next to each issue to represent their proposals. 

#### Amendments
Skip amendments and voting for the first round, or until people feel comfortable.
Players may request to add or remove blue cards. At least one original blue card must remain as part of the core bill.

#### Amendment voting
Once a new blue card has been added to the amendments area . Decide ahead of time if this vote is binding (i.e. the player proposing the bill must) or not.

#### Final Voting
Once there are no more amendments, bill voting starts. Players may vote one of three ways.
Aye: Vote yes
Nay: Vote no
Present: Vote to abstain and extend discussion
Bills need a simple majority (50%+1) to pass. For example, with 6 players, 4 people must vote yes with zero abstain votes. If two vote to abstain, 3 people must vote yes.
Bills need 50% +1 to extend discussion.  For example, with 6 players, 3 people must vote to extend.
Otherwise, the bill fails.
After voting, each person who voted on the winning side receives their salary of one money token. This only applies if the bill passes or fails. Continuing discussion does not count.  On passing the bill, play the blue cards on the table. If issues cancel each other out, return them to the deck.

## CAMPAIGN
After each player has had a turn as chairperson, it is time for campaigning and elections.  Each player will return to their homes to face their constituents and campaign for re-election. Each player gets one point for each objective they’ve met and can spend money on their bid for re-election.

#### Victory Check
If anyone has satisfied all their red cards, they win.
Otherwise, each player gets one point per satisfied red card. If they have more than one card relating to an issue, they score each individually.

#### Campaigning and Spending
Spend four tokens on yourself to gain one point.
Spend four tokens on another player to make them lose one point.
Spend two tokens on another player to void a specific issue. For example, Player 1 believes Player 2 has a red diamond, but isn’t sure if it’s positive or negative. Player 1 spends two tokens and tells Player 2 to void red diamond; Player 2 will lose one point if he possesses a red diamond, regardless of direction. Each player can only have an issue voided once. While negative campaigning works, there’s a diminishing return on how much attention constituents will pay. Player 2 does not need to say if Player 1’s assumption was correct.

#### Election
Once the election starts, players count their score.
2 or more: Win re-election
If you have met 2 or more objectives, your constituents believe in you enough to send you back for another term and reward you with two money tokens. Draw one red card from the top of the deck and return one. This will reflect how their wishes will change in the coming term. Decide beforehand if players are allowed to return the card they just drew.
1 or less: Lose re-election
If you have met less than two objectives,
Consequences may vary, from getting a new stack of red cards, to losing your turn, to losing your money tokens. Be sure to decide beforehand and write this in your charter.

## HOUSE RULES
This game, like real-life legislation, has many variations and styles. This manual leaves it as an exercise to the players. Here are some things to consider:
* How do you facilitate discussion?
* How is turn order determined?
* Are private sidebars allowed?
* Are amendment votes binding?
* When can money change hands?
* Have you tried a formal structure for discussion like Roberts’ Rules of Order?
* How does voting happen?
* Are votes public record?

Most of the numbers in this manual can also be changed for your own purposes.  Make sure everyone understands and agrees to the rules prior to set-up. All major changes should be noted in your charter and amendments.

## VARIATIONS AND ADVANCED RULES
Here are some suggestions for ways to change the game that have not already been discussed. Like house rules, all changes should be noted in the charter.

#### Bill Modifiers
Once you understand the basic mechanics, you can introduce yellow cards to modify bills at proposal time. You may get a surprise bonus… or an unpleasant hurdle.

#### Conflicting Interests
When everyone has a good grasp of the rules, you can change them to allow players to hold onto conflicting red cards. For example, if a player has ♥+ and ♥-, the goal is to keep ♥ at zero. If a player has 2 ♥+ and ♥-, the goal is to keep ♥ at exactly +1.

#### Public eye
After some time, citizens will pay attention to your voting pattern. Players get +½ point each time they vote in favor of their goals and -½ point each time they vote against it. Additionally, players get +½ point each time they draft a bill or pass an amendment in favor of their goals and -½ point each time they draft a bill or pass an amendment against it. If playing with conflicting interests, each red card counts individually. 

#### Teams
Legislating can be hard when you’re working against everyone. So why not work with friends for a change? Players are divided into approximately equal teams. For set-up, each team gets two red cards. Each player gets two red cards.  Each player is required to meet their team’s objectives, plus their own. For an extra challenge, players can win independent of their partners.

#### Stalled Legislation
An extra rule to incentivize good bill writing and raise the stakes. If more than 50% of motions fail in a single session, the citizenry will get upset and revolt under the belief that you aren’t doing your job.  At this point, all players lose and face the consequences.

#### Parties
Like teams, except more fluid. Consequences of losing reelection include reassignment to another team.

#### Loyalty to the Crown
Add some blank red cards to the deck. If you get that red card, your objective is to stall legislation by causing four bills to fail.  This is the only card you need to satisfy to win. Normal election rules apply to other issues during the campaign phase.

#### Single Party
Why fight with your fellow when you can work together? Instead of having a single winner, all legislators win and lose as a team. Use deductive reasoning 

#### Assimilation
Consequences of losing reelection include elimination from the game. After re-election, losers turn their red cards into a discard pile. Remaining players draw from the pile. Add extra red cards if necessary to ensure remaining players draw a minimum of one. Thresholds for re-election may also rise with time.

#### Balanced Budget
Active law must sum up to 0. After everyone has had an opportunity to submit one bill, gameplay continues until the sum of active law is negative (i.e. + outweighs -). If everyone sequentially fails to pass a bill, everyone loses and faces the consequences. You may wish to split the red deck between + and - during setup to ensure everyone’s initial red cards are likewise balanced. For an extra twist, include only + cards.


## TEACHER’S GUIDE
Educators may find value in bringing this game to the classroom. Below are some examples of how this game can enhance your curriculum.

#### Legislative Process and Procedure
At heart, this game is about the legislative process. There is a lot of room to change the rules in terms of discussion, amendments and voting. Ask students what they do and do not like. Note differences in voting patterns in public and secret voting. Encourage students to think of better ways to facilitate gameplay, and if possible translate that into ways methods of lawmaking can change or historical examples of how rules have changed.

#### Public Speaking and Debate
While red/blue issue cards are not intended to reflect actual issues, teachers may create scenarios to encourage students to talk about actual issues, write notes or give speeches based on the state of play and their goals. Consider decorum rules to keep discussion focused on issues and not other players. Demonstrate consequences when they do.

#### Teamwork and Party Systems
Teachers can emphasize lessons in teamwork and logical deduction to determine other’s goals. Parallels between real-life party systems can help highlight how they came to be and formed their bases.
